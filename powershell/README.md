# PowerShell Profile

## Installation

Before installation, we have to set our PowerShell execution policy to allow the use of scripts.
To do this, open your PowerShell as an administrator and run the following command:

```PowerShell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

Then copy `profile.ps1` to `C:\User\USERNAME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\profile.ps1`.
